# As Of April 22 2025, Luna Is Officially Discontinued And Will Be Deprecated Soon With The Upcoming Release Of [Starlight](https://github.com/Nebula-Softworks/Starlight-Interface-Suite).  
  
#### The Library Will Still Be Usable, But Will No Longer Receive Updates (Including Bug Fixes and Patches), Meaning It Is Highly Dis-recommended. We Will Eventually Start Auto-Migrating Scripts Using Luna To Starlight In The Near Future Once It Is Released. However, If You Insist On Using Luna, A Way Will Be Added To Still Use It Via getgenv() Variables. Thank You For Your Understanding.
